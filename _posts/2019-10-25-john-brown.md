I have been interested and reading history since I was a kid. But I had barely touched American History before I had finished my undergrad. 

On a friend's recommendation I picked up , what is probably one of my favorite books now , *A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn*. I have since then become really interested in pre-civil era and the reconstruction era. Of all the great figures that have emerged throught the nations history, the one I admire and find interesting the most is John Brown.
There have been many articles penned down by many much learned people on John Brown and his life. I would like to not dive deep into his actions but rather his beliefs and ideologies and what he stood for. 

Brown on the evening of October 16,1859 , just months before the start of the American Civil War , led a militia into the town of Harper's Ferry in a bid to instigate a slave rebellion and arm slaves with weaponry to stand against the slave-owners in defiance. He was greatly outnumbered by the government and the local militia, was captured and sentenced to hang.
Many people have called him a fanatic, to which I'll say a fanatic with a right cause can be one of the more noble people we can conceive of. These acts of 'fanaticism' have been throughtout history have been necessary to ignite many revolutions and movements of justice. Albert Camus' Rebel goes much deeper into the necessity and occuerence of such incidents and rebeliions throughout history. Is it not a streak “madness” that always makes a martyr?

John Brown was very deeply religiously and pious person and he believd in God in a way we don't really see it in our times. His belief system was so strong and he was so strongly touched by the spiritual fire that he had enough conviction to be invovled in such a violent incident. And in that sense his conviction is scary, as it is simply something we don't see and recognize these days. He did not want earhtly glory,recognition nor any of the rewards people had in their power to Bestow. His heard was set on the far loftier ambition of really wanting all human beings to live and experience lives as equalt.The idea of sacrificing yourself for the benefit of others is harder to come by in our era due to the pure alienation between the material conditions and the lives we live. He had been for years already carrying a warfare against slavery and ad only a few followers, but to his mind his duty was clear. It was enough for him to fight it out to the bitter end and if need be alone.
With every drop of his honest blood he hated slavery, and in his early life he had resolved to lay his life in wiping out that insufferable affliction. In the society which treated fellow humans with such contempt John Brown felt this silence of logic,absence of reason and death of pity. This drove him to a wrath of retribuitve justice and he struck a mortal blow to the presence of chattel slavery. The government and pro-slavery powers reacted by condeming him to be executed. But his work was done, the raid was the last of the acts which led to Civil War and abolition of slavery. Victor Hugo had even claimed : 'John Brown is grander than George Washington'. Here is a text from an open letter than Victor Hugo wrote in December 2 ,1859: 

>Politically speaking, the murder of John Brown would be an uncorrectable sin. It would create in the Union a latent fissure that would in the long run dislocate it. Brown's agony might perhaps consolidate slavery in Virginia, but it would certainly shake the whole American democracy. You save your shame, but you kill your glory. Morally speaking, it seems a part of the human light would put itself out, that the very notion of justice and injustice would hide itself in darkness, on that day where one would see the assassination of Emancipation by Liberty itself. ... Let America know and ponder on this: there is something more frightening than Cain killing Abel, and that is Washington killing Spartacus.

From the beginning of his life to towards the end he had one ideal and that was to destroy slavery. He hand since then been memorialized as a heroic martyr and a visionary. I will always admire him and consider him one of the greatest Americans to have lived , not for his violent acts but his commitment to what was right and selflessness in a very hostile world.

And I would like to conlcude this with a quote from Eugene Debs:
>Old John Brown is not dead. His soul still marches on, and each passing year weaves new garlands for his brow and adds fresh lustre to his deathless glory.
