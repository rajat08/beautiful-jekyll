As I sit alone at my home on a rather dull Christmas evening (thanks Covid), after a day full of LeetCode and job applications,I am quite frankly, bored. I am This blog post is a result of the need to quell that boredom.

I thought I'd share something from the amazing book [Genghis Khan and Quest for God by Jack Weatherford](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/543962/genghis-khan-and-the-quest-for-god-by-jack-weatherford/) .Perhaps a few paragraphs might make some want to pick up this great read.

By 1787 , the great British historian [Edward Gibbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibbon) was toward the end of his fifteen year long project of writing about the Roman Empire. By this time he was finishing the last of his six volumes covering *'more than 170 emperors,over 25 dynasties and 1500 years encompassing Europe,Africa and Asia from the Assasination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC until the fall of Constantine XI to the Turks on May 29,1453'*. At his time , Gibbon knew more about empires and emperors than any other scholar then or probably even now.

But by the time his project was nearing end his interest was being drawn towards the future as much as it was in the past.His interest was drawn across the Atlantic Ocean by the newly formed  American Empire which was destined to be the imperial heir to Rome. Gibbon closely followed the American debate regarding religion in society,public life and politics.During his time at Oxford, Gibbon has had the chance being around some of these young American rebels, he was well aware of their radical ideas and how difficult it would be to realize them. In that age while philosophers mused over the idea of religious freedom, no one knew how to create a scoiety and laws that embodied this principle. Americans, led by Thomas Jefferson, were opting to offer citizen total religious freedom and a complete separation of church from state.

Gibbon had acquired deep insight into the power dyanmics between state and religion through his studies and his service as a member of Parliament. But after a lifetime of studies he conclude that one ruler stood above all others in matters of politcis and God: Genghis Khan.
From his study of Western history , Gibbons came to believe that Europe offered no sound model for establishment of religious freedom. He boldly stated *'But it is the religion of Zingis(as he called Genghis Khan) that best deserved our wonder and applause'* in the last volume on the Romans. Gibbons stated in his study that Mongol camps had great religious diveristy and they lived in harmony. As long as they would abide by *Ikh Yasa*, the Great Law, Khan respected the rights of even the most hostile sects. He also said that by that contrast European hisotry often had been shaped by religious fanatics *'who defended nonsense by cruelty* and might have been *'confounded by the example of a Barbarian who established a system of pure theism and perfect toleration.'*

But few had the chance to read Gibbon's great works, as they were entirely banned across much of the continent. The Cahtolic Church had put his names in the Vatican's list of banned books, thereby making the reading and printing of his books a sin and a crime in many places. His ideas were too radical and his books remained on this list of forbidden books untl the Church finally abolished it in 1966. Gibbons had posited in his discussion of Genghis Khan , linking him to European philosophical ideas of tolernace and to religious freedom in the emerging Unided States. Gibbon specifically cited John Locke's utopian vision in the [Fundamental Constitution of Carolina](https://www.ncpedia.org/fundamental-constitutions) , which Locke had written in 1669 to govern the newlt acquired North American lands.

The author the book, Jack Weatherford spent many years trying to answer the question of 'Did the Founding Fathers of the United States had access to knowledge about Genghis Khan's Great Law and if so, had they copied it ?'. He found various instances of substantive proofs that George Washington indeed did have books related to Genghis Khan in his library but he had no proof on wether Washington ever did read those. 
His search has reinvigorated when he found that merchants in Boston had imported and sold books on the Mongol Leader in the late 1700s. In fact, he also discovered that the book *'The Great History of Genghizcan the Great, First Emperor of the Ancient Moguls and Tartars'* was the most popular book in the American colonies in the 18th century. Benjamin Franklin took great interest in that book and did much to popularize it.

Weatherford hit a crucial point in his search when he found Thomas Jefferson the author of Declaration of Independence owned copies of this popular book on Genghis Khan and he was the fouding father with moth copies of this book. Jefferson bought copies of the biography in the original French language for himself and offered them as gifts for others. His copies of this book made way to US Library of Congress and University of Virginia; both of these instituitons were founded by Jefferson.

In 1777,one year after the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson translated its lofty words into specific legilsations when he composed America's first law of religious freedom for his native state of Virginia. He had embraced the idea of religious freedom before reading about Genghis Khan, but what he found in the biography was a specific way to translate the desire for religious freedom into law. Religious freedom was an individual right, not a prerogative of the Church. Further in the book author gives us examples in the similarity of language used in the Declaratio of Independence and Genghis Khan's laws.

The horror of Genghis Khan's conquests are well-known, but his role as a religious lawmaker remains largely unexplored. Late in his life he drew religious leaders from far and wide to his camp and his struggle to create a lating peace among many competing religions whose animosities plagued humanity. What began as his personal struggle to find his spirituality gradually became a quest to understand the role of religion in society. The ideas of Genghis Khan were revolutionary in the 13th century, when he lived, and in the 18th century when the founders of America found him,and they remain so today.
