Hello there ! My name is Rajat & I am currently a grad student studying AI at Boston University.

I like all tech stuff but mostly ML and MLOps. I have worked on NLP , vision and plenty of other cross domain ML projects.


## What do i do for fun

When I'm not being a computer nerd,I just shift on to being a history & anthropology nerd. I read a lot and I love talking (lots) about any topic under the sun. I'm a big soccer fan and have been a die hard Liverpool fan since I was a kid. 

I would also probably use the adjective 'gamer' to describe myself. I mostly play RPGs. I've been playing guitar since school and have a wall full of Led Zeppelin posters.
