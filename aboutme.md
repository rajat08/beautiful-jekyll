Hello there ! My name is Rajat & I am currently a grad student studying AI at Boston University.

I like all tech stuff but mostly ML. I have worked on NLP , vision an plenty of other cross domain ML projects, hence within ML, I do not restrict myself to any specific subset of tasks. I enjoy reading about anything data related even if I don't always practice it myself.

When I'm not being a computer nerd,I just shift on to being a history,anthropology & philosophy nerd. I read a lot and I love talking (lots) about any topic under the sun. I'm a big soccer fan and have been a die hard Liverpool fan since I was a kid. 

I would also probably use the adjective 'gamer' to describe myself. I mostly play RPGs. I've been playing guitar since school and have a wall full of Led Zeppelin posters. 


**EDIT**

If you are reading this , you have found me at a time when I am job hunting. So if you know about an awesome ML engineer or Data Scientist opening I would love to talk to you. 

You can have a look at my <a href="/assets/files/resume.pdf" download target="_blank">resume</a>, and if you like it please find me via LinkedIn,Email,Twitter whatever you medium you may prefer.

Thanks!
